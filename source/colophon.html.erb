  <h2>
    Colophon
  </h2>
  <p>
    There's not much need for colophons on the web, but I think strange loops where the work references itself are pretty fascinating.

  <p>
    The headings are in Futura and Open Sans. The body text is set in Georgia. These will almost definitely change in the future.

    Built with Middleman with regular ol' ERB, CSS, and vanilla JS.
