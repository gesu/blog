    I own a <%= link_to "1984 Mercedes Benz 380SL", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_R107_and_C107" %>. It's a great car but it's also 30+ years old so it requires some maintenance. If you're looking for technical docs on this car, here are the <%= link_to "official Mercedes Benz guides", "//www.startekinfo.com/StarTek/outside/11883/PROGRAM/84380sl.html" %>. There's a lot of good information in there, but it also has <em>the worst</em> site navigation I've ever seen.

    Here's some of the projects that I've done:

        <%= link_to "Power Steering Pump Rebuild", "/power-steering-pump-rebuild.html" %>
